        "\n",
        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . A parameter is a value the model learns during training, like weights in a linear regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Correlation shows how two variables are related — whether they increase or decrease together.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . It means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Machine Learning is when computers learn from data to make predictions. Key components: data, model, algorithm, and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Loss shows prediction error. Lower loss means a better model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Continuous: numeric values (e.g., income).\n",
        "   Categorical: group values (e.g., color, gender).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . We convert them to numbers using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Training data teaches the model. Testing data checks how well it learned.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . A module in scikit-learn for data preparation like scaling and encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a Test set?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . A separate dataset used to check model performance after training.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Use train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Understand problem → Collect data → Clean & explore data → Choose model → Train → Evaluate → Improve.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . EDA helps us understand the data, spot patterns, and handle missing or incorrect values.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . It shows how two variables are related.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . One variable increases while the other decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Use df.corr() in pandas or seaborn.heatmap(df.corr()) for visuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Causation means one variable causes another to change.\n",
        "Example: Studying causes better grades (causation), while ice cream sales and drowning have correlation, not causation.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Optimizers adjust model parameters to reduce error.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "SGD: updates with each sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adam: adapts learning rate and combines momentum.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is sklearn.linear_model ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . A module for linear models like Linear and Logistic Regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . It trains the model. You need input features (X) and target labels (y).\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . It makes predictions. You give it new input data (X).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Continuous: measurable (e.g., height).\n",
        "Categorical: labels or categories (e.g., city).\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . It adjusts feature values to the same range. Helps models converge faster and improve accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do we perform scaling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Use StandardScaler() or MinMaxScaler() from sklearn.preprocessing.\n",
